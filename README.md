# beef-s-bot
It's probably a bot, made in Python, that can play YouTube music. It's currently being worked on and has some bugs.

If you plan to use it, create a .env file with the following:

DISCORD_TOKEN = ****

BOT_ID = ****

If you want to host it on your own computer, please install ffmpeg. If it is not installed, it will cause errors.
